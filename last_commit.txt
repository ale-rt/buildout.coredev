+The migration-form warns you if any of your old types were extended with additional fields using `archetypes.schemaextender   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archetypes.schemaextender/>`_. The data contained in these fields will be lost during migration (with the exception of images added with collective.contentleadimage).
 
 To keep the data you would need to write a custom migration for your types dexterity-behaviors for the functionality provided by the schemaextenders. This is an advanced development task and beyond the scope of this documentation.
