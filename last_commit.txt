-- Related Items refactorings:
-
-    - Make "search" and "browse" mode user-selectable via buttons.
-
-    - Remove obsolete tree widget, use "browse" mode instead.
-
-    - Let "search" mode search recursively.
-
-    - Let "browse" mode start from current path.
-
-    - Immediately open select2 results when clicking on "Browse" or "Search" or browsing somewhere.
-
-    - Show only selectable items in "search" mode, if defined.
-
-    - Show only selectable and folderish items in "browse" mode, if selctable items are defined.
-
-    - Exclude already selected items in result list.

-
-    - Adapt TinyMCE pattern to related item changes and remove now obsolete selection and result templates.
-
-    - Calculate all paths relative to the ``rootPath``, so that breadcrumbs navigation and favorites do not show paths outside the rootPath.

-
-- More Related items pattern:
-
-    - Result button style allow for more room for scrollbar, and have subltle color change on hover to deliniate user-expected behavior of browsing vs. selecting item.
-
-    - Related Items pattern: content icon cross-compatibility with Plone 5.x and 4.x (via plone.app.widgets 1.x); in Plone 5 getIcon returned from brain is a boolean, in Plone 4, it is a string -- use this to show content icons in Plone 5 as previous, but also show image scale in Plone 4, but only for images.  This is the most reasonable solution to avoid requesting many broken image scales (404) in Plone 4.

-- Structure pattern refactorings:
-
-    - Prevent popovers to be closed when clicking on non-visible elements which still use screen space (those with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0). That in addition to elements, which are not visible at all and do not use screen space (display: none). Prevents upload form in structure pattern to be closed when opening the file selection tool.
-
-    - Use thumb scale for image preview in rename dialog and optimize the rename dialog layout.
-
-    - Remove ``pat-relateditems`` path selection widget but make sure, the path can still be set via navigation within the structure pattern.
-
 Bug fixes:
 
 - Fix the tests for 2.1.x by aligning package.json to master and reverting commit 3f1b741 as it was reverted in master also.
